1.Made a free trial on Azure
2.Created a Virtual Machine with Windows 10, default size, RDP 3389 port, and a resource group, changed the security group so all connections are allowed
3.Created a log analytic workspace to take logs from the VM from WE logs (show where attacks are coming from) SIEM will take the data and put it on a map
4.Security Center - enabled ability to allow logs from VM to go to log analytic workspace
5.Azure Sentinel SIEM - clicked the workspace so it can start analyzing the data

1. once logged into the VM open event viewer and search for Audit Failure ID#4625, this will show failed logon attempts to the VM
	a. shows the username they tried to use to login
	b. shows the machine they tried to login
	c. shows the error Bad username or Bad Password
	d. shows Source Network Address (shows where it failed from)
2. use ipgelocation.io api to take the basic geographic data to make a custom log to the log analytic workspace and use sentinel to plot out the attackers on the map
	a. turn off firewall on the VM so its discoverable on the internet (pinged VM from main PC and it was able to echo a ping)
	b.go to powershell and use script from https://github.com/joshmadakor1/Sentinel-Lab/blob/main/Custom_Security_Log_Exporter.ps1
		i. api key 3564c518697440239317a1b97d877178
	c. runs script that will look for event 4625 and take the IP and gets the geodata and creates a log file. get output to C:\ProgramData\$logfile
	d.go to azure and createa custom log that will take in all the data from the failed_rdp.log file
	e.when making the custom fields, modify the custom fields and label them and correctly identify their field type latitude, longitude, 	destinationhost, sourcehost, state, country
3. go to azure sentinel
	a. create a new workbook with the new query FAILED_RDP_WITH_GEO_CL | summarize event_count=count() by sourcehost_CF, latitude_CF, longitude_CF, country_CF, label_CF, destinationhost_CF
	| where destinationhost_CF != "samplehost"
	| where sourcehost_CF != ""
	
	we also want to visualize it with a world map by lat/long
	we can also label the metrics by label and event_count to show us how many failed logons from an IP address there is
	b. after creating the visualization leave the VM running overnight and PS1 script as well running and you'll notice different logon attempts from China Russia Philippines Taiwan India 

and the lab is done! =)
